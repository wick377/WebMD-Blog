<p>With Google Meet, upto 250 people can join a virtual meeting, and speak or share video with each other from anywhere with internet access.</p>

<p><br>A Google Meet organizer, who starts a meeting, can share whatever is on their screen with everyone on a call, and any participant can turn their own audio and/or video feed off at any time, participating however they want.</p>
<p>Google Classroom — the tool for collaboration, and discussion; has Meet integrated to quickly generate managed video calls.<br>Educators can create a unique Meet link for each class, which is displayed on the Classroom Stream and Classwork pages. The link acts as a dedicated meeting space for each class, making it easy for both teachers and students to join.</p>
